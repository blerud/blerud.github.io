I think it's always interesting to read other people's reading lists, so here's mine

Books I've read, listed in no particular order

 - [A Random Walk down Wall Street](https://www.amazon.com/Random-Walk-Down-Wall-Street/dp/0393352242) - I'll
    summarize it as "buy VTSAX"
 - [Superintelligence](https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0198739834)
 - [Steve Jobs](https://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537)
 - [The Inner Game of Tennis](https://www.amazon.com/The-Inner-Game-Tennis-Performance/dp/0679778314) - I read
    this during the peak of my Super Smash Brothers Melee interest as a book about psychology for competition,
    but the concepts of "self 1" and "self 2" are applicable to all parts of life
 - [Failure is Not an Option](https://www.amazon.com/Failure-Is-Not-Option-Mission/dp/1439148813)
 - [More Money Than God](https://www.amazon.com/More-Money-Than-God-Making/dp/1594202559)

 - [Principles: Life and Work](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Life-Work-Ray-Dalio/dp/1501124021) - most people
    probably loosely follow most of the principles in this book, but it's good to read them written down as
    concrete text

    fucked me up, being old sucks
 - [Meditations](https://www.amazon.com/Meditations-New-Translation-Marcus-Aurelius/dp/0812968255)
